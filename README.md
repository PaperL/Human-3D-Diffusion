# Human-3D-Diffusion
> SJTU Course CS348: Computer Vision (2022 Fall) Team B Project.

- Code in folder `improved_diffusion` is forked from [openai / improved-diffusion](https://github.com/openai/improved-diffusion) under the **MIT license**.
- Human pose data format refers to `HumanData` class and tools from [open-mmlab/mmhuman3d](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmhuman3d)
  - Model execution relies on *MMHuman3d*, read the submodule documents for the [installation tutorial](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmhuman3d/blob/main/docs_zh-CN/install.md)
- Our diffusion model input data structure is converted from [mmhuman3d.HumanData['smpl']](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmhuman3d/blob/main/docs/human_data.md)
- Group meeting notes and other materials are uploaded to the `utility` branch
